**Unit 2: Trade and Externalities** <span id="2"></span> 
*Trade theory forms part of the bedrock of economic analysis.  The
concept of specialization is key to understanding how to maximize an
individual’s or country’s wellbeing.  Skills, resources, and knowledge
are unequally distributed; it is the relative differences which drive
trade.*  
    
 *The free market is not always the optimal way to allocate scarce goods
and resources.  Actions and choices can have unintended effects which
can harm or benefit others.  How to best manage these effects, known as
externalities, depends on the specifics of each problem.  Economists
have a variety of tools to redress misallocation.*  
    
 *Public goods are a unique consideration, because they are a common
resource which cannot be assessed an individual economic cost.  Without
proper management, public goods may be over-consumed and lead to
degradation of resources.  Geography pays an important part in public
good analysis.*

**Unit 1: Introduction and Basic Concepts** <span id="1"></span> 
*This unit provides an overview of basic economic concepts.  We begin
with a definition of economics and then move to apply its basic tools of
analysis.  Next, supply and demand is considered from a theoretical
standpoint and then is quantified.  The unit closes with a discussion of
government intervention and how it affects the market.*  
    
 *As you work through this unit, consider the economic objectives of
individuals, firms, and the government.  Think about how the three
interact in a shared economic space.  Remember to maintain an objective
viewpoint about all economic analysis and reflect on the quantitative
methods developed to support economic theory.*

**Unit 5: Competition** <span id="5"></span> 
*Economists organize firms into various categories known as market
structures.  A monopoly is a single firm in an industry which, even in
the absence of competition, still needs consumer demand to reach
equilibrium.  Unregulated monopolies are not efficient and charge higher
prices than in a competitive market structure.*  
  
 *Oligopolies have only a handful of firms in an industry and may either
cooperate or compete.  Cooperative oligopolies can work together to
charge higher prices and limit choices.  Competitive oligopolies have
lower prices and offer more, although limited, choices.  The choice to
cooperate or compete can be described using game theory, which is a set
of rules and assumptions about how firms make choices.*  
    
 *Knowledge is power.  Information is not equally and perfectly
distributed to all economic agents.  Firms and individuals must make
choices with the limited amount of data and information available.
 Asymmetrical information can lead to unequal and inefficient outcomes.

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   Explain both competitive markets, for which basic models of supply
    and demand are most appropriate, and markets in which agents act
    strategically, for which game theory is the more appropriate tool.
-   Compare and contrast arguments concerning business and politics, and
    make good conjectures regarding the possible solutions.
-   Apply basic tools that are used in many fields of economics,
    including household economics, labor economics, production theory,
    international economics, natural resource economics, public finance,
    and capital markets.

     Instructions: Please read all seven sections of this chapter.
    Consider which monopolies exist in your local area.  Recall that a
    monopoly has 100% of a market.  What role, if any, does regulation
    play?

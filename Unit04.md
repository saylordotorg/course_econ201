**Unit 4: Consumer Theory and Equilibrium** <span id="4"></span> 
*This unit addresses the other main agent in microeconomics—the
individual consumer.  Similar to firms, individuals face constraints in
the form of a budget.  Time, available resources, and options are not
static and make individual economic analysis challenging. Individuals
also have unique preferences, and there is no one direct path to utility
maximization.*  
    
 *Microeconomists make a number of underlying assumptions about consumer
behavior and choices to construct mathematically elegant models.  As
each of the assumptions is relaxed, a more realistic paradigm of
individual behavior emerges.  When learning an economic model, first
accept the assumptions and then consider how they might be modified.*  
    
 *General equilibrium brings together the problems of the firm and the
individual.  Equilibrium answers the questions at what price and
quantity will consumers and firms make exchanges.  Of note, an
equilibrium may not always exist; alternative allocation mechanisms can
be considered.*

**Unit 3: Producer Theory and Investment** <span id="3"></span> 
*Every firm faces one primary constraint: a budget.  The balance between
costs and revenues will determine a firm’s profit.  Firms will seek to
minimize costs; this implies that they are a profit maximizer.  Every
firm also has long and short run decisions.  Remember that short run
decisions allow for changing one of the factors of production, usually
labor.  Long run analysis is far more complex, because multiple factors
of production are adjustable.*  
    
 *Economic and market conditions change over time.  A firm must
carefully weigh expected changes in the future when making decisions
today.  Risk can vary over time and can be anticipated and insured
against.  Uncertainty is more difficult to model and can significantly
change the overall environment. *
